# Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization
A data-driven project to analyze traffic accident data and uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. This project aims to identify accident hotspots and highlight contributing factors to improve public safety and awareness.

# Objectives
- Analyze traffic accident datasets to find patterns and trends

- Study how weather, road conditions, and time influence accidents

- Visualize accident hotspots using heatmaps and charts

- Gain actionable insights that can assist in urban planning and traffic safety measures

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Accident dataset (can be from sources like Kaggle or government open data)

# Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and understand the dataset

- Time-based analysis (Hour, Day, Month)

-  Weather and road condition correlation

- Visualization of high-risk zones and accident density

# Visualizations
- Heatmaps of accident locations

- Hourly/weekly accident trends
